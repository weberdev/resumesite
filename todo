Somehow make these look good.
I'm not sure what to do with this, but I'd like to get a bit more content here.
We're grinding stuff out for daily github commits.
This continues. My next task is to move my Blood Bowl app to React and output it here.
The real question: do I store all the data on my server and pass the prehandled information? The domain of data is finite- I'll need to rerun it biannually, but then I have 4gb of raw text on my server- not trivial. Running the thing client side will take 20 minutes.
I didn't do that today- working.
Myy team has excitedly started messing around with Unity in my absence. I will join them.
However, I did not do that today.
The next unity design step: figuring out how to hang monster icons in the combat engine.
After that, get art.
After that, add music. I have many musicians ready to go.


Current task: art, and finding a place to hang it. This is easier said than done. I'm not sure how to follow up on it. Artists like money, which is fair.
Art plan: have each artist take either a zone or a monster genus, and lead art direction for that.
