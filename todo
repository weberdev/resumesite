Somehow make these look good.
I'm not sure what to do with this, but I'd like to get a bit more content here.
We're grinding stuff out for daily github commits.
This continues. My next task is to move my Blood Bowl app to React and output it here.
The real question: do I store all the data on my server and pass the prehandled information? The domain of data is finite- I'll need to rerun it biannually, but then I have 4gb of raw text on my server- not trivial. Running the thing client side will take 20 minutes.
I didn't do that today- working.
Myy team has excitedly started messing around with Unity in my absence. I will join them.
However, I did not do that today.
The next unity design step: figuring out how to hang monster icons in the combat engine.
After that, get art.
After that, add music. I have many musicians ready to go.

Musicians are ready. We are working on concept art for zones now.
Current plan: Calcifornia art. This is done.
Current task: get art for Synthgrave from somewhere on my hdd.
There's likely more to do.

Maybe I should figure out how to decode TOME saves. Pouring over hexcode is actually kind of fun.

To do this, I'd need to get a process that listens for new TOME saves made in my me/tome4/saves/ folder.
Decodes the .teag file into a zip.
Extracts the gamestate "cults/secret code" line
transforms it into images

There are powershell tools for listening to file updates.
There might be an elegant way to read directly from the hex to my output. Unsure.
I should ask someone who knows. Random linkedin messages: not great.
What was this about?

I'm writing something to update my github.

I should go get some Dying Earth stories to inspire Age of Dust.
Is age of dust a good name?
I think it might be.

Won a sealed at my LGS somehow. I miss it.
